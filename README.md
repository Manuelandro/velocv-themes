# VeloCV's theme repository

## Why should I create a VeloCV theme?

* **Credits**: you're allowed to put your credits in the footer of the theme, every user that will select your theme will show your name/link to all his contacts
* **Money** (not available yet): if the VeloCV user buys the premium service (which is also not available yet) credits are removed but we're working with tax consultants to understand if we can pay a fee to the designer (some money for every day or usage of your themes and for every user)

## Overview of the process of creating a theme

* Fork this repository
* create a new folder, it will be the name of your theme
* create (inside the folder) a js file with the name name of your folder and .js extension
* create (inside the folder) a css file with the name name of your folder and .css extension
* tweak the js/css files as you wish (keep reading for guidelines)
* create a pull request for us to approve the theme
